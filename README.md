# Low-Level Design (LLD) – End-to-End Preparation (Python)

This repository contains a **complete, structured implementation of Low-Level Design (LLD)** concepts using **Python**, built with **product-based company interview expectations** in mind.

The focus is on **design clarity, extensibility, testability, and clean abstractions**, not on frameworks or boilerplate.

---

## 🎯 What This Repository Covers

### 1️⃣ Core OOP Fundamentals
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Composition vs Inheritance
- Dependency Injection

---

### 2️⃣ SOLID Principles (Applied Together)
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Each principle is demonstrated using:
- Real-world examples
- Common interview pitfalls
- Correct refactored designs

---

### 3️⃣ Design Patterns (Practical Use)
- Creational: Factory, Builder
- Structural: Adapter, Facade
- Behavioral: Strategy, Observer

Patterns are used **only where they add value**, avoiding over-engineering.

---

### 4️⃣ Real-World LLD Case Studies
Interview-relevant design problems such as:
- Notification System
- Parking Lot System
- Payment System
- File Storage System
- Rate Limiter
- LRU Cache

Each problem includes:
- Requirement breakdown
- Class-level design
- Clean, extensible code
- Discussion of trade-offs

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- Favor **composition over inheritance**
- Depend on **abstractions, not implementations**
- Avoid large `if-else` blocks
- Write code that is **easy to extend and test**
- Optimize for **readability and maintainability**

---

## 🧪 Testing & Extensibility

- All designs support dependency injection
- Mock implementations are easy to plug in
- New features can be added without modifying stable code

---

## 🎤 Interview Perspective

This repository is built to help answer:
- “Why did you choose this design?”
- “How would you extend this system?”
- “What trade-offs did you consider?”

Every design is written with **interview explanation clarity** in mind.

---

## 🚀 Who Is This For?

- Engineers preparing for **LLD interviews**
- Developers strengthening OOP & design skills
- Candidates targeting **product-based companies**
- Anyone aiming for clean, scalable code design

---

## 📌 Scope Disclaimer
This repository focuses on **low-level design** and **does not cover high-level system design (HLD)** such as distributed systems or scalability patterns.

---

## 🧠 Author
Built as part of a structured and disciplined LLD learning journey.
